# Scaffold Ruble
This is a port of my original CSScaffold Textmate Bundle (github.com/brianegan/CSScaffold.tmbundle).
The purpose of this bundle is to provide a range of helpful snippets that will speed up development
time in Textmate and Aptana while helping you learn all that Scaffold has to offer.

## Download

* Click "Download Source" button at the top-right of this page, or
* Click the "Downloads" tab and choose the most recent file, or 
* Clone the repo into your "Aptana Rubles" folder like a pro.

## Installation

* Navigate to your "Aptana Rubles" folder
  * ex Windows: C:\Users\Brian\Aptana Rubles
  * ex Mac: /Users/Brian/Documents/Aptana Rubles
* Extract the zip into the "Aptana Rubles" folder
* If necessary, rename the extracted folder to "Scaffold.ruble"
* If Aptana is open, you'll need to restart it. Doing "Update User Bundle" alone will not activate the new snippets at this time.
