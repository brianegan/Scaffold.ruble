# Scaffold Ruble
This is a port of my original CSScaffold Textmate Bundle (github.com/brianegan/CSScaffold.tmbundle).
The purpose of this bundle is to provide a range of helpful snippets that will speed up development
time in Textmate and Aptana while helping you learn all that Scaffold has to offer.
